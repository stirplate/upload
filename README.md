Stirplate.io Data Upload Helper
===============================

Sequencing data may be sent to Stirplate several ways.

1. Manual data upload via [stirplate.io](https://stirplate.io).
2. **RECOMMENDED**: Automatic upload from a local computer directly to Stirplate without user interaction (outlined in this document).


Prerequisites:
--------------
- To setup and run automated data upload to Stirplate, be sure you have your Stirplate User Credentials (please contact keith@stirplate.io to obtain these).
- Python 2.7.x (untested on Python >= 3).
- Python packages `boto3` and `mando`.
	- To install `boto3` to your python environment, use PIP: `pip install boto3`
	- To install `mando` to your python environment, use PIP: `pip install mando`


Configure Access:
-----------------
Configure your Stirplate Access Credentials.

1. **Interactive**: Simply type:
```
python stirplate.py configure
```

2. **Automatic**: (Recommended) "Install" the supplied configuration file automatically from a downloaded config file:
```
python stirplate.py configure --install /path/to/stirplate/config
```

- Alternatively, you may pass your access credentials as parameters during the upload phase (not recommended).


Uploading and starting the Stirplate RNA-Seq protocol:
------------------------------------------------------
There are two ways to run the data upload helper for the Stirplate RNA-Seq (DESeq2) protocol:

1. **Interactive**. Simply type:
```
python stirplate.py rna
```
	- You will be prompted for the input directory containing your sequencing data, as well as additional meta data (species, single stranded protocol) information.

2. **Automatic**. Simply run:
```
python stirplate.py rna
--directory /path/to/input/sequencing/data/
--project_name MyProjectName
--species SPECIES
```
	- Species choices are: `C_ELEGANS` (worms), `D_RERIO` (zebrafish), `H_SAPIENS` (humans), `M_MUSCULUS` (mouse), or `R_NORVEGICUS` (rat).
	- If the experiment was performed using a single strand protocol, pass the `--single_stranded_protocol` flag as well.
	- Upon running, all files in your input sequence data `directory` will be uploaded to Stirplate.io. The uploading is optimized for speed so your data will be transferred in the least amount of time. **Processing will begin at Stirplate as soon as the last file transfer has completed**.

At any point you may get additional command line usage help by typing:

- `python stirplate.py -h`
- `python stirplate.py rna -h`
